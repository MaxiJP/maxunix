Hello everybody out there using linux -

I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like linux) for my x86(64) clones.

yeah yeah okay jokes over. but seriously, this will not spew into something massive. i honestly don't have the time or will power for that. who knows, maybe ill generate a community so large that I can actually get other people to do it for me lol.
